# Proforma 2

This is an (almost) non Javascript solution for the former Proforma. It keeps the workings intact (accessibility and all). There's just a little bit of Javascript needed for the file upload, but that weighs in  at a little over 500 bytes. That code can be integrated in your own Javascript file for less HTTP requests.

The CSS is pretty much self explanatory, I've added some comments for clarification. Further styling is up to you!

This should work in pretty much all browsers, but keep in mind that Internet Explorer support is from version 10 and up.
